CHARITY DONATION APP

THE VIMAL FOUNDATION Goals which were set by India for a worldwide cause for achieving universal primary education have been missed. Nearly 385 million children worldwide are experiencing extreme poverty and marginalized state of living. Some regions such as west and central Africa are most challenging for the living conditions of children. Primary school going children have been declined from 99 to 59 million. These and many other facts and figure are the reason of concern and tends to make NGO like ours to make an effort in raising donations for poor and needy children.
