# Contributing Guidelines

- **Plagiarism is strictly not allowed**. Any work that is found to be
  suspicious of plagiarized work will not be merged.
- Issues will be assigned on a _first come, first serve_ basis. You just have to
  comment on the issue, asking to be assigned, and it will be done if found fit.
- Preferably, you cannot work on any issue that is not assigned to you.
- In case you want to submit an improvement to an existing algorithm, we prefer
  that you create an issue, describing in details your improvement. This will
  help others to analyze your contribution. You can use the
  [templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/algorithm-ds-proposal.md) that we have
  provided :)
- If you have anything else in mind, create an issue and please wait for it to
  be assigned to you. You can then start working on it and create a PR.
- All PRs must be made from a Branch. Create a separate branch for every Issue
  you are working upon and once found fit, make a PR.
- If you have no idea what are issues or PRs, please do refer to
  [this link](https://github.com/Tenet-Coding/ArtofCoding/wiki/Pull-Requests-%7C-What-are-they-and-how-to-do-it-%3F)

Make sure your code works before submitting it :D
